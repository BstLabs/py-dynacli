# Why DynaCLI?

There are so many libraries out there for writing command line utilities; why does DynaCLI exist?

Our core differentiator: we do not build all commands upfront but rather form arg parser dynamically thus supporting unlimited one-end cli structure.

You can have dozens of packages and modules which are going to be converted to CLI without defining CLI commands beforehand.

## TODO: add more words here

DynaCLI was written to support the CAIOS ecosystem because no tool could provide it with the functionality it needed.

We strongly recommend reading our tutorials to get the ideas how and when DynaCLI can be really helpful and how you can benefit from it.
